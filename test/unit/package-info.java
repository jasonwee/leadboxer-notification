/**
 * 
 * Unit testing aims to verify each part of the software by isolating it and then perform tests to demonstrate that each 
 * individual component is correct in terms of fulfilling requirements and the desired functionality.
 * 
 * This type of testing is performed at the earliest stages of the development process, and in many cases it is executed by 
 * the developers themselves before handing the software over to the testing team.
