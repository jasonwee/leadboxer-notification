/**
 *
 * Integration testing aims to test different parts of the system in combination in order to assess if they work correctly
 * together. By testing the units in groups, any faults in the way they interact together can be identified.
 *
 * There are many ways to test how different components of the system function at their interface; testers can adopt either
 * a bottom-up or a top-down integration method.
