/**
 * 
 * Acceptance testing is the level in the software testing process where a product is given the green light or not. The aim of 
 * this type of testing is to evaluate whether the system complies with the end-user requirements and if it is ready for 
 * deployment.
 * 
 * The testing team will utilise a variety of methods, such as pre-written scenarios and test cases to test the software and 
 * use the results obtained from these tools to find ways in which the system can be improved.
 * 
 * The scope of acceptance testing ranges from simply finding spelling mistakes and cosmetic errors, to uncovering bugs 
 * that could cause a major error in the application.
